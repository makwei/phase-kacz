This package includes all the data and codes for reproducing the figures in the manuscript
                 "Solving systems of phaseless equations via Kaczmarz methods: A proof of concept study" 
                 (old title "Phase retrieval via Kaczmarz methods").

It includes nine folders: 
-- Gaussian, CDP1d, CDP2d, Unitary: this four folders contain the data for the transition plots;
-- Timing: this folder contains the data for the timing table;
-- Noise: this folder contains the data for the noise plots;
-- Image: this folder contains the data for the image timing table;
-- Plots: this folder contains all the plots and .tex files for the timing tables;
-- Scripts: this folder contains all the matlab codes for generating and processing the data files, 
           and reproducing all the plots in the manuscript. Those tasks can be completed by the single 
           "do_all.m" script in the folder.


To get started, go to the Scripts folder, run "do_all.m" script which will reproduce all the plots 
in the manuscript. Cancel the corresponding comments if you want to generate the data of your own.
